                    <li>Complete renewal of failed surfaces</li>
                    <li>Where asphalt is badly cracked, deformed or patched, removing the old layer and replacing it with new mix eliminates underlying defects instead of simply hiding them.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Opportunity to upgrade design and materials</li>
                    <li>Reconstruction allows TRAI to adjust layer thicknesses, choose more durable mixes and incorporate additives or recycled content that improve long-term performance and sustainability.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>

        <h3>Kerbstone and interlock installation - Key Benefits</h3>
        <p>Kerbstone and interlock installation from TRAI completes the road construction story by combining structural control with a high-quality architectural finish around the carriageway. Clients get edges, pavements and paved areas that are aligned to design levels, built for heavy use and visually consistent with the rest of the project.</p>
        <div class="benefits">
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Engineered edges for safer roads</li>
                    <li>Kerbstones are set to precise lines and levels, helping to contain the pavement, protect verges and manage surface water so the asphalt performs as designed. Strong, correctly founded kerbs also guide drivers and define safe pedestrian areas, improving overall road safety and legibility.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Durable, flexible interlock pavements</li>
                    <li>Interlocking blocks distribute loads across many units, creating a robust surface that resists cracking and rutting under traffic and temperature changes.

                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Premium visual finish and place-making</li>
                    <li>A wide choice of block colours, textures and patterns allows TRAI to align pavements, medians, plazas and parking bays with the client’s landscape and branding vision. Clean kerb lines and well-cut interlock patterns give projects a polished, “finished” look that enhances curb appeal and the perceived value of the entire development.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Integrated with the full road build</li>
                    <li>Because TRAI manages milling, asphalt laying, kerbs and interlock together, levels, joints and transitions are coordinated from the outset, avoiding ponding, trip lips and awkward steps. One experienced road contractor taking responsibility for the whole cross-section means smoother delivery, fewer interface issues and long-term performance that matches the design intent.</li>

        <h2>2. Road Marking Application</h2>
        <p><strong>Title: “Lines That Lead the Way”</strong></p>
        <p>Clear, long-lasting markings are critical for safe, intuitive navigation on any network. TRAI Contracting specifies and applies the right marking system for each site, balancing durability, visibility, cost and environmental performance.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Thermoplastic road markings: Thermoplastic markings offer exceptional life and reflectivity on heavily trafficked roads and highways. Glass beads and anti-skid aggregates can be incorporated to maximize night-time visibility and braking performance in wet conditions.</li>
            <li>2K MMA (cold plastic) systems: Cold plastic MMA markings are used in high-stress areas such as intersections, roundabouts, bus lanes and cycle routes where superior strength is needed. Their high film thickness, colour stability and skid resistance provide reliable performance even under aggressive braking and turning.</li>
            <li>Cold paint and specialist line marking: Cold-applied paints are ideal for car parks, airports, logistics yards and sports areas that require fast application and minimal downtime. Using advanced spray equipment, layouts are set out and applied with precision to optimize space and traffic flow.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Thermoplastic Marking – Key Benefits</h3>
        <p>Hot Applied Road Marking (Thermoplastic Road Marking or Pavement Marking) from TRAI completes the road construction story by pairing a high-quality surface with long-life, high-visibility guidance for every road user. It is ideal for highways, city streets, car parks and special zones where safety, durability and professional presentation matter most.</p>
        <div class="benefits">
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Maximum safety and visibility</li>
                    <li>Thick, reflective thermoplastic lines and symbols stand out in day, night and wet conditions, giving drivers more time to see lanes, crossings and warnings and react safely. Retroreflective glass beads and optional profiled markings enhance night-time guidance and can create rumble effects that encourage drivers to slow down in critical areas.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Long-lasting, low-maintenance markings</li>
                    <li>Hot-applied thermoplastic bonds strongly to asphalt and primed concrete, forming a robust layer that resists wear from heavy traffic, braking and extreme weather far better than conventional paint. This extended service life reduces the frequency of remarking, cutting future maintenance costs and limiting the need for repeated traffic closures.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Fast application, less disruption</li>
                    <li>Once applied at the correct temperature, thermoplastic cools and hardens within minutes, allowing roads to reopen quickly and keeping disruption to residents, businesses and through-traffic to a minimum.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>Versatile layouts for any project</li>
                    <li>The material can be used for center and edge lines, arrows, symbols, speed roundels, crossings, cycle lanes, bus lanes, parking bays and traffic-calming features, giving TRAI the flexibility to deliver complete pavement marking packages on complex schemes.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <ul>
                    <li>End-to-end professionalism from a road specialist</li>
                    <li>Because TRAI also handles milling, asphalt laying, kerbs and interlock, levels and layouts are coordinated so markings sit exactly where designers intended—clear of joints, ponding and defects. This integrated road construction expertise means clients get crisp, accurate, regulation-compliant markings that look professional from day one and continue to perform throughout the life of the pavement.</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>2K MMA (Cold Plastic) Marking – Key Benefits</h3>
        <p>2K MMA (cold plastic) markings from TRAI provide ultra-durable, high-visibility guidance in the most demanding locations, backed by full road-construction expertise and specialist product training. This service is ideal for junctions, roundabouts, crossings, bus and cycle lanes, high-traffic approaches and any area where conventional paint wears out too quickly.</p>
        <div class="benefits">
            <div class="benefit-item">
                <h4>Performance and safety benefits</h4>
